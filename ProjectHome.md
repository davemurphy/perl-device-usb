Device::USB provides a Perl wrapper for the libusb library. The module started off as a thin layer over libusb. It has now been extended to provide a few more Perl-ish methods.

There is still a bit of a disconnect between the Windows ppm version and the CPAN version.

  * CPAN: 0.29
  * Windows PPM: 0.28

This module was originally developed by members of Houston.pm.

As of 2014/02/28, this project has been moved to github: https://github.com/gwadej/perl-device-usb, you can find the most up-to-date code there.
